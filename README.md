## General Info
War or Peace was a solo project assigned during week 1 of Mod 1 of 4 for Turing's School of Software and Design.

My challenge was to create a program to stimulate a game of war. A user is able to create two players, and watch them 'play' the game. The game is currently being played between Monkey D. Luffy and Don Quixote Doflamingo but feel free to change the names. I will explain how to change the names under [Usage](#usage).

## Learning Goals
* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request

## Technologies
* Ruby 2.7.2
* RSpec
* Atom
* Git

## Usage
In your terminal, run `git clone` with the copied URL onto your local machine.<br><br>
Then, run the following commands:
```
cd war_or_peace
ruby war_or_peace_runner.rb
```
If you would like to change the name of the players, open the directory with your text editor (e.g. from the CLI, `atom .` or `code .`). Navigate to the `war_or_peace_runner.rb` file and change the names on lines 67 and 68.
